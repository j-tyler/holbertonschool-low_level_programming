# Assignment Solutions from [Justin Marsh](http://https://twitter.com/dogonthecircuit)

** Welcome to Low-Level Programming! **

This repository holds my assignment solutions from the low-level programming 
track at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com). Each folder contains functions on a given topic 
that fulfill given assignment specifications.

** Whats in here? **

Each directory contains my code as I progressed through the Holberton program. 
These assignments were small-scale, with one day completion times for each folder. 
As such, the code here are samples of my work as time progressed. If 
you are interested in my work in larger-scale complete programs, 
see any of these week long projects that I have worked on:
